CSS-only demo of a combination lock animation

[Demo](https://merncraft.github.io/lock)

It's easy to find the combination that opens the lock, but, you know, I like words to be spelt correctly, and most economical solution. Of the 24 possible orders in which you can change each letter only once, only one meets my high standards. The other 23 will trigger an alarm when you press Enter.

If you looked here for a hint, I think you deserve this:

WELL
v
DELL
 v
DOLL
   ^
DOLE
  v
DONE
