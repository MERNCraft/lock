Each letter has four radio buttons:

up-forwards    down-forwards
down-reverse   up-reverse              

Only one can be active at a time. If x-forwards is pressed, it cannot be triggered again until another button in its group is pressed. Its corresponding y-forward button is moved behind the x-reverse button in a lower layer.

The buttons now available are x-reverse and <:checked>. Clicking on x-reverse plays the same x animation in reverse order.

The correct button to press must also hide a "bad" button that covers the next correct button to press.
